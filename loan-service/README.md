# Deprecated Root: loan-service

This root is deprecated and frozen for new feature development.

Use canonical module locations instead:

1. Domain code: `loan-context/`
2. Deployable runtime services: `services/`
3. Shared foundations: `shared-kernel/`, `shared-infrastructure/`, `common/`

Any change under `loan-service/` requires explicit architecture approval and migration rationale in the PR.
