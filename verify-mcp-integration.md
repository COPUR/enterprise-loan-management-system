## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /Users/alicopur/Documents/GitHub/enterprise-loan-management-system/src/main/java
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
java com.bank.loanmanagement.LoanManagementApp
```

### 2. Verify MCP Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/ai/health
```

Expected response should show:
- `"status": "MCP_OPERATIONAL"`
- `"mcp_enabled": true`
- `"framework": "MCP + SpringAI + OpenAI GPT-4"`

### 3. Run MCP Test Suite
Use the test file `test-mcp-integration.http` to run comprehensive tests.

## Technical Architecture

```
User Request → HTTP Handler → MCP NLP Adapter → {
    MCP Banking Server (Banking Context) +
    SpringAI Chat Client (AI Processing) +
    OpenAI GPT-4 (Language Understanding)
} → Enhanced Banking Response
```
