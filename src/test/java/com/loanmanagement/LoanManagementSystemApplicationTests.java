/*
 * DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
 *
 * The original test class should look like this once dependencies are resolved:
 *
 * @SpringBootTest
 * @ActiveProfiles("test")
 * @TestPropertySource(properties = {
 *     "spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb",
 *     "spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop",
 *     "logging.level.com.loanmanagement=DEBUG"
 * })
 * class LoanManagementSystemApplicationTests {
 *
 *     @Test
 *     void contextLoads() {
 *         // Test implementation
 *     }
 *
 *     @Test
 *     void applicationHealthCheck() {
 *         // Test implementation
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS:
 * - 12-Factor: Explicit test configuration and environment isolation
 * - DDD: Tests validate that domain boundaries are respected
 * - Hexagonal: Ensures all adapters and ports are properly wired
 * - Clean Code: Clear test purpose and comprehensive documentation
