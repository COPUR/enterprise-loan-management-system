 * To restore full functionality:
 * 1. Run: ./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies

/*
 * SPRING BOOT RESTORATION GUIDE:
 *
 * Once dependencies are resolved, restore this structure:
 *
 * @SpringBootApplication
 * @EnableTransactionManagement
 * @ComponentScan(basePackages = {
 *     "com.loanmanagement.application",
 *     "com.loanmanagement.infrastructure",
 *     "com.loanmanagement.loan"

 * public class LoanManagementSystemApplication {
 *     public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         SpringApplication.run(LoanManagementSystemApplication.class, args);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS:
 * - 12-Factor: Explicit configuration, environment parity, logs as event streams
 * - DDD: Clear bounded contexts and domain model separation
 * - Hexagonal: Clean separation between business logic and technical concerns
 * - Clean Code: Self-documenting, maintainable, and testable structure
