## Architecture Diagrams

### Domain-Driven Design Model

![Domain Model](docs/diagrams/docs/diagrams/svg/domain-model.svg)

The domain model encompasses three primary bounded contexts: Customer Management, Loan Origination, and Payment Processing, with shared kernel components for common financial operations.

### Bounded Context Relationships

![Bounded Contexts](docs/diagrams/docs/diagrams/svg/bounded-contexts.svg)

Each bounded context maintains independence while coordinating through well-defined interfaces and event-driven communication patterns.

### Hexagonal Architecture Implementation

![Hexagonal Architecture](docs/diagrams/docs/diagrams/svg/hexagonal-architecture.svg)

The hexagonal architecture ensures technology independence and maintainability through ports and adapters pattern, enabling flexible infrastructure integration.

### Business Process Workflow
