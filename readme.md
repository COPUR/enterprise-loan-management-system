### Bounded Contexts (Domain-Driven Design)
1. **Customer Management** - Customer profiles, credit scoring, KYC compliance, risk assessment
2. **Loan Origination** - Loan applications, approval workflows, business rule validation, documentation
3. **Payment Processing** - Payment scheduling, transaction processing, installment calculations, reconciliation

## Domain Model & Business Logic

### Core Domain Entities

![Domain Model](docs/compiled-diagrams/svg/Domain%20Model.svg)

The domain model implements sophisticated banking entities with comprehensive business rule validation:

**Customer Aggregate**
- Profile management with KYC compliance
- Credit score validation (300-850 range)
- Risk assessment and categorization
- Contact information and verification status

**Loan Aggregate**
- Application workflow with approval states
- Interest rate calculations (0.1%-0.5% monthly)
- Installment options (6, 9, 12, 24 months)
- Amount validation ($1,000-$500,000 range)

**Payment Aggregate**
- Installment scheduling and calculations
- Payment method support (ACH, Wire, Online Banking)
- Late fee calculations and penalty management
- Transaction history and reconciliation

### Bounded Contexts Architecture

![Bounded Contexts](docs/compiled-diagrams/svg/Bounded%20Contexts.svg)

The system implements Domain-Driven Design with three distinct bounded contexts:

**Customer Management Context**
- Customer profile management
- Credit scoring and risk assessment
- KYC compliance verification
- Customer communication preferences

**Loan Origination Context**
- Loan application processing
- Business rule validation
- Approval workflow management
- Document management and storage

**Payment Processing Context**
- Payment scheduling and processing
- Transaction validation and settlement
- Payment method integration
- Reconciliation and reporting

### Database Schema & Relationships

![Entity Relationship Diagram](docs/compiled-diagrams/svg/Entity%20Relationship%20Diagram.svg)

The database design ensures data integrity with comprehensive relationships:

- **Referential integrity** with foreign key constraints
- **Audit trail** for all financial transactions
- **Optimized indexing** for performance
- **Data partitioning** for scalability

### Business Process Workflows

#### Loan Creation Sequence

![Loan Creation Sequence](docs/compiled-diagrams/svg/Loan%20Creation%20Sequence.svg)

The loan origination process implements a comprehensive workflow:

1. **Application Submission** with data validation
2. **Credit Assessment** using external bureau integration
3. **Business Rule Validation** for interest rates and terms
4. **Risk Evaluation** with automated scoring
5. **Approval Decision** with audit trail
6. **Documentation Generation** and customer notification

#### Payment Processing Sequence

![Payment Processing Sequence](docs/compiled-diagrams/svg/Payment%20Processing%20Sequence.svg)

Payment processing ensures secure transaction handling:

1. **Payment Initiation** with method validation
2. **Amount Verification** against outstanding balance
3. **Payment Gateway Integration** with secure transmission
4. **Transaction Settlement** with confirmation
5. **Account Update** and notification delivery
6. **Reconciliation Processing** for audit compliance
