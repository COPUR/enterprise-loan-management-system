## Today's Banking with Tomorrow's needs - business use case driven future proof architecture Implementation
## Enterprise Loan Management System

Today's digital banking landscape requires systems that are not only scalable and secure, but also resilient, auditable, and future-proof by design.

This Enterprise Loan Management System is engineered with a pure hexagonal architecture and founded on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The platform reflects a business use case-driven approach, enabling banking institutions to adapt with agility, maintain regulatory compliance, and accelerate delivery velocity without compromising architectural integrity.

##  Next-Generation Banking Platform with Zero-Trust Security

The **Enhanced Enterprise Banking System** represents the pinnacle of modern financial services architecture - a **secure microservices platform** built with **zero-trust security**, **OAuth 2.1 authentication**, and **Istio service mesh**. Designed for enterprise banking institutions that demand uncompromising security, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence.

This platform transcends traditional banking systems by implementing a **secure-by-design architecture** that enforces security at every layer, from network communication to application logic, ensuring comprehensive protection of financial data and operations.

##  Architecture Overview

![Enhanced Enterprise Banking Security Architecture](docs/images/Enhanced%20Enterprise%20Banking%20Security%20Architecture.svg)

### Core Design Principles

- **Zero-Trust Security**: Never trust, always verify with mTLS everywhere
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean separation of business domains and concerns  
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Pure domain logic with infrastructure abstraction
- **OAuth 2.1 Compliance**: Latest security standards with FAPI integration
- **BIAN Alignment**: Banking Industry Architecture Network compliance
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-first design with service mesh security

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Zero-Trust Networking** | mTLS encryption for all service communication |  Production Ready |
| **OAuth 2.1 Authentication** | Keycloak-based identity management with FAPI compliance |  Production Ready |
| **Istio Service Mesh** | Comprehensive traffic management and security |  Production Ready |
| **Banking Compliance** | PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, and FAPI frameworks |  Production Ready |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | 6 bounded contexts with clean architecture |  Production Ready |
| **Islamic Banking** | Sharia-compliant financial instruments |  Production Ready |

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21+** (Latest LTS)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Kubernetes 1.28+** (for production)
- **kubectl and helm** (for K8s deployment)

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/COPUR/enterprise-loan-management-system.git
cd enterprise-loan-management-system

# 2. Build the application
./gradlew clean bootJar

# 3. Start infrastructure services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.enhanced-test.yml up -d postgres redis keycloak

# 4. Start the banking application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.enhanced-test.yml up -d banking-app-enhanced

# 5. Verify deployment
curl -k https://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes with Istio service mesh
kubectl apply -f k8s/keycloak/
kubectl apply -f k8s/istio/
kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/

# Monitor deployment
kubectl get pods -n banking-system
kubectl get svc -n banking-system
```
