The enterprise loan management system implements a layered architecture with clear separation between client applications, security gateway, core banking services, and data persistence layers.

### Domain-Driven Design Model

![Domain Model](docs/enterprise-governance/documentation/generated-diagrams/Domain%20Model.svg)

The domain model encompasses three primary bounded contexts: Customer Management, Loan Origination, and Payment Processing, with shared kernel components for common financial operations.

### Bounded Context Relationships

![Bounded Contexts](docs/enterprise-governance/documentation/generated-diagrams/Bounded%20Contexts.svg)

Each bounded context maintains independence while coordinating through well-defined interfaces and event-driven communication patterns.

### Hexagonal Architecture Implementation
