# Terraform Stubs for Microservices

This folder provides baseline Terraform stubs for microservice infrastructure.

- `modules/microservice-base`: shared module with variables and placeholder outputs.
- `services/<service-slug>`: service‑specific instantiation stubs.

These stubs are intentionally minimal and should be completed with cloud provider resources.
