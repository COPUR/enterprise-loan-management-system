# Open Finance Monitoring and Compliance Infrastructure

## Overview
Comprehensive monitoring and compliance infrastructure implementation for UAE CBUAE Open Finance regulation C7/2023 compliance and PCI-DSS v4 security standards.

## Components Implemented

### 1. PrometheusMetricsCollector
**File**: `open-finance-infrastructure/src/main/java/com/enterprise/openfinance/infrastructure/monitoring/PrometheusMetricsCollector.java`

**Features**:
- API performance metrics (request duration, throughput, error rates)
- Security violation tracking (FAPI 2.0 compliance, DPoP validation)
- Consent management metrics (creation, revocation, validation timing)
- Cross-platform data sharing metrics (saga execution, latency)
- PCI-DSS v4 compliance scoring (real-time calculation)
- Audit event tracking with temporal correlation

**Key Metrics**:
- `openfinance_api_request_duration` - API response times by endpoint/participant
- `openfinance_security_violations_total` - Security violations by type/severity
- `openfinance_consent_validations_total` - Consent validation results
- `openfinance_data_sharing_duration` - Cross-platform data aggregation timing
- `openfinance_pci_compliance_score` - Real-time PCI compliance score (0-100)

### 2. ComplianceMonitoringService
**File**: `open-finance-infrastructure/src/main/java/com/enterprise/openfinance/infrastructure/monitoring/ComplianceMonitoringService.java`

**Features**:
- CBUAE regulation C7/2023 compliance checking
- PCI-DSS v4 automated compliance validation
- FAPI 2.0 security protocol compliance monitoring
- Continuous compliance monitoring (5-minute intervals)
- Daily compliance report generation
- Real-time violation detection and scoring

**Compliance Checks**:
- Consent validity and scope compliance
- Participant authorization verification
- Data access patterns and limits validation
- Customer notification requirements
- Audit trail completeness verification
- Data encryption compliance (AES-256-GCM)
- Access control implementation
- Network security controls
- Monitoring and logging completeness
- Authentication security (multi-factor)

### 3. AlertingService
**File**: `open-finance-infrastructure/src/main/java/com/enterprise/openfinance/infrastructure/monitoring/AlertingService.java`

**Features**:
- Multi-channel alerting (Email, Slack, SMS, Webhooks)
- Severity-based escalation (LOW → HIGH → CRITICAL)
- Security violation immediate notifications
- Compliance breach automated reporting
- Performance degradation alerts
- Data sharing failure notifications
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- Executive compliance reporting

**Alert Types**:
- **Security Alerts**: FAPI violations, DPoP failures, unauthorized access
- **Compliance Alerts**: CBUAE violations, PCI-DSS breaches, audit failures
- **Performance Alerts**: API latency, throughput degradation, timeout issues
- **Data Sharing Alerts**: Saga failures, platform connectivity, timeout

### 4. TDD Test Suite
**File**: `open-finance-infrastructure/src/test/java/com/enterprise/openfinance/infrastructure/monitoring/PrometheusMetricsCollectorTest.java`

**Test Coverage**:
- API metrics recording and aggregation
- Security violation tracking
- FAPI compliance check validation
- Consent lifecycle metrics
- Data sharing performance tracking
- Compliance violation recording
- Health metrics calculation
- Platform latency tracking

## Monitoring Architecture

### Real-time Metrics Pipeline
```
API Request → Security Validation → Metrics Collection → Prometheus → Grafana Dashboard
     ↓              ↓                      ↓
Compliance Check → Violation Detection → Alerting → Multi-channel Notification
```

### Compliance Monitoring Flow
```
Scheduled Check → CBUAE/PCI Validation → Score Calculation → Report Generation → Distribution
                           ↓
                    Violation Detection → Immediate Alert → Escalation Chain
```
