### 🎬 **UAT Test Scenarios**

#### **1. Customer Onboarding Journey**
```gherkin
Feature: Customer Onboarding Process
  As a customer service representative
  I want to onboard new customers efficiently
  So that they can access banking services quickly

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a customer service representative
    And I have access to the customer onboarding system
    And all external services are available

  Scenario: Successful Individual Customer Onboarding
    Given a new individual customer wants to open an account
    When I start the customer onboarding process

      | Driver's License  | Uploaded  |
      | Proof of Income   | Uploaded  |
      | Proof of Address  | Uploaded  |
    And I submit the customer application
    Then the system should validate the information
    And initiate KYC verification process
    And create a customer profile
    And assign a unique customer ID
    And send welcome email to customer
    And log all actions in audit trail
    
  Scenario: KYC Verification Process
    Given a customer application is submitted
    When the KYC verification process starts
    Then the system should:
      | Action                           | Expected Result    |

#### **3. UAT Test Execution Process**
```java
@Component
public class UATTestOrchestrator {
    
    @Autowired
    private UATTestDataManager testDataManager;
    
    @Autowired
    private UATTestReporter testReporter;
    
    public UATTestResults executeUATTests() {
        UATTestResults results = new UATTestResults();
        
        // Phase 1: Environment validation
        results.addPhase(validateEnvironment());
        
        // Phase 2: User journey testing
        results.addPhase(executeUserJourneys());
        
        // Phase 3: Business process testing
        results.addPhase(executeBusinessProcesses());
        
        // Phase 4: Edge case testing
        results.addPhase(executeEdgeCases());
        
        // Phase 5: Performance validation
        results.addPhase(validatePerformance());
        
        // Phase 6: Security validation
        results.addPhase(validateSecurity());
        
        // Generate comprehensive report
        testReporter.generateUATReport(results);
        
        return results;
    }
    
    private UATTestPhase validateEnvironment() {
        UATTestPhase phase = new UATTestPhase("Environment Validation");
        
        // Validate all services are running
        phase.addTest(validateServiceHealth());
        
        // Validate test data is loaded
        phase.addTest(validateTestData());
        
        // Validate external service connections
        phase.addTest(validateExternalServices());
        
        return phase;
    }
    
    private UATTestPhase executeUserJourneys() {
        UATTestPhase phase = new UATTestPhase("User Journey Testing");
        
        // Customer onboarding journey
        phase.addTest(executeCustomerOnboardingJourney());
        
        // Loan application journey

        // Fraud investigation journey
        phase.addTest(executeFraudInvestigationJourney());
        
        return phase;
    }
}
```

### 📊 **UAT Metrics and Success Criteria**

#### **1. Business Acceptance Criteria**
```java
@Component
public class UATAcceptanceCriteria {
    
    public static final Map<String, Double> ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS = Map.of(
        "user_satisfaction_score", 8.5,
        "task_completion_rate", 95.0,
        "error_rate", 2.0,
        "response_time_95th_percentile", 3.0,
        "business_process_accuracy", 99.5
    );
    
    public AcceptanceResult evaluateAcceptance(UATTestResults results) {
        AcceptanceResult result = new AcceptanceResult();
        
        // User satisfaction evaluation
        double satisfactionScore = results.getUserSatisfactionScore();
        result.addCriteria("User Satisfaction", 
            satisfactionScore, 
            ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("user_satisfaction_score"),
            satisfactionScore >= ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("user_satisfaction_score"));
        
        // Task completion rate
        double completionRate = results.getTaskCompletionRate();
        result.addCriteria("Task Completion Rate", 
            completionRate, 
            ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("task_completion_rate"),
            completionRate >= ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("task_completion_rate"));
        
        // Error rate
        double errorRate = results.getErrorRate();
        result.addCriteria("Error Rate", 
            errorRate, 
            ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("error_rate"),
            errorRate <= ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("error_rate"));
        
        // Performance criteria
        double responseTime = results.getResponseTime95thPercentile();
        result.addCriteria("Response Time (95th)", 
            responseTime, 
            ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("response_time_95th_percentile"),
            responseTime <= ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("response_time_95th_percentile"));
        
        // Business accuracy
        double businessAccuracy = results.getBusinessProcessAccuracy();
        result.addCriteria("Business Process Accuracy", 
            businessAccuracy, 
            ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("business_process_accuracy"),
            businessAccuracy >= ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.get("business_process_accuracy"));
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

#### **2. UAT Sign-off Process**
```java
@Component
public class UATSignoffManager {
    
    public enum SignoffStatus {
        PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS
    }
    
    public class StakeholderSignoff {
        private String stakeholderRole;
        private String stakeholderName;
        private SignoffStatus status;
        private String comments;
        private LocalDateTime signoffDate;
        private List<String> conditions;
    }
    
    public SignoffResult collectSignoffs(UATTestResults results) {
        SignoffResult signoffResult = new SignoffResult();
        
        // Business users signoff
        signoffResult.addSignoff(collectBusinessUserSignoff(results));
        
        // Operations team signoff
        signoffResult.addSignoff(collectOperationsSignoff(results));
        
        // Compliance officer signoff
        signoffResult.addSignoff(collectComplianceSignoff(results));
        
        // Risk management signoff
        signoffResult.addSignoff(collectRiskManagementSignoff(results));
        
        return signoffResult;
    }
}
```

This comprehensive UAT strategy ensures **business stakeholder validation** and **production readiness confirmation** through structured user journey testing and formal sign-off processes.
