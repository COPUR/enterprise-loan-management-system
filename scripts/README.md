```

### 2. `run-validation.sh`
**Quick runner for comprehensive validation**

Simple one-click script that runs the full hexagonal architecture validation with proper error handling and directory checks.

##  Validation Criteria

### Domain Purity Requirements
-  **Zero JPA Contamination** - No `jakarta.persistence` imports in domain
-  **No Spring Dependencies** - No `org.springframework` imports in domain
-  **Infrastructure Isolation** - No infrastructure package imports
-  **Annotation Free** - No `@Repository`, `@Service`, `@Component` in domain

### Factory Method Requirements
-  **Loan.create()** - Static factory method for loan creation
-  **LoanInstallment.create()** - Static factory method for installment creation
-  **No Builder Patterns** - Factory methods preferred over builders in domain

### Domain Events Requirements
-  **Minimum 8 Events** - Comprehensive lifecycle coverage
-  **Proper Inheritance** - All events extend `DomainEvent`
-  **Event Coverage** - Application, approval, payment, default, restructure events

### Architecture Quality Metrics
-  **Loan Domain** - 424+ lines of pure business logic
-  **LoanInstallment** - 215+ lines of business rules
-  **Test Coverage** - 87.4%+ overall, 95%+ domain layer
-  **Value Objects** - Strong typing and immutability

##  CI/CD Integration

These scripts are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- name:  Hexagonal Architecture Validation
  run: |
    ./scripts/hexagonal-architecture-validation.sh validate
```

The validation runs automatically on:
-  Push to main/develop branches
-  Pull requests
-  Manual workflow dispatch
-  Release workflows

##  Example Output

 Ready for production deployment!
```

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Domain Contamination:**
```bash
# Fix JPA contamination
find src/main/java -path "*/domain/*" -name "*.java" -exec grep -l "jakarta.persistence" {} \;
```

**Missing Factory Methods:**
```bash
# Check factory method implementation
grep -r "public static.*create" src/main/java/*/domain/
```

**Insufficient Domain Events:**
```bash
# List current domain events
find src/main/java -path "*/domain/*/event/*" -name "*Event.java"
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Java 21** - Required for compilation
2. **Gradle** - Build tool (./gradlew)
3. **Git** - Version control
4. **Bash** - Shell environment

### Script Permissions

If scripts are not executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

##  Continuous Improvement

These scripts evolve with the architecture:

- **Version Tracking** - Scripts versioned with code
- **Metric Evolution** - Quality gates adjust with maturity
- **New Validations** - Additional checks as architecture grows
- **Performance Optimization** - Script execution improvements

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new validation rules:

1. **Add to validation function** - New check in appropriate section
2. **Update requirements** - Document new criteria
3. **Test thoroughly** - Validate on clean and contaminated code
4. **Update CI/CD** - Ensure pipeline integration
5. **Document changes** - Update this README
