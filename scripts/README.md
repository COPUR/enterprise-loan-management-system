## 🎯 Validation Criteria

### Domain Purity Requirements
- ✅ **Zero JPA Contamination** - No `jakarta.persistence` imports in domain
- ✅ **No Spring Dependencies** - No `org.springframework` imports in domain
- ✅ **Infrastructure Isolation** - No infrastructure package imports
- ✅ **Annotation Free** - No `@Repository`, `@Service`, `@Component` in domain

### Factory Method Requirements
- ✅ **Loan.create()** - Static factory method for loan creation
- ✅ **LoanInstallment.create()** - Static factory method for installment creation
- ✅ **No Builder Patterns** - Factory methods preferred over builders in domain

### Domain Events Requirements
- ✅ **Minimum 8 Events** - Comprehensive lifecycle coverage
- ✅ **Proper Inheritance** - All events extend `DomainEvent`
- ✅ **Event Coverage** - Application, approval, payment, default, restructure events

### Architecture Quality Metrics
- ✅ **Loan Domain** - 424+ lines of pure business logic
- ✅ **LoanInstallment** - 215+ lines of business rules
- ✅ **Test Coverage** - 87.4%+ overall, 95%+ domain layer
- ✅ **Value Objects** - Strong typing and immutability

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

These scripts are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- name: 🏗️ Hexagonal Architecture Validation
  run: |
    ./scripts/hexagonal-architecture-validation.sh validate
```

The validation runs automatically on:
- ✅ Push to main/develop branches
- ✅ Pull requests
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch
- ✅ Release workflows

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Domain Contamination:**
```bash
# Fix JPA contamination
find src/main/java -path "*/domain/*" -name "*.java" -exec grep -l "jakarta.persistence" {} \;
```

**Missing Factory Methods:**
```bash
# Check factory method implementation
grep -r "public static.*create" src/main/java/*/domain/
```

**Insufficient Domain Events:**
```bash
# List current domain events
find src/main/java -path "*/domain/*/event/*" -name "*Event.java"
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Java 21** - Required for compilation
2. **Gradle** - Build tool (./gradlew)
3. **Git** - Version control
4. **Bash** - Shell environment

### Script Permissions

If scripts are not executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

These scripts evolve with the architecture:

- **Version Tracking** - Scripts versioned with code
- **Metric Evolution** - Quality gates adjust with maturity
- **New Validations** - Additional checks as architecture grows
- **Performance Optimization** - Script execution improvements

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new validation rules:

1. **Add to validation function** - New check in appropriate section
2. **Update requirements** - Document new criteria
3. **Test thoroughly** - Validate on clean and contaminated code
4. **Update CI/CD** - Ensure pipeline integration
5. **Document changes** - Update this README
