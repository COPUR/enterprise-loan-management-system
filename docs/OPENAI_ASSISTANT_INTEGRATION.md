## Python Banking Assistant Usage

### Direct Command Line Execution
```bash
cd src/main/python
python3 banking_assistant.py
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
import asyncio
from banking_assistant import BankingAssistant

async def example_usage():
    assistant = BankingAssistant()
    
    # Initialize the assistant
    await assistant.initialize_assistant()
    
    # Process banking queries
    response = await assistant.handle_banking_conversation(
        "Analyze the loan portfolio performance for the last quarter"
    )
    
    print(f"Assistant Response: {response}")

# Run the example
asyncio.run(example_usage())
```

### Available Python Methods
- `analyzeCustomerRisk(customerId)`: Comprehensive risk assessment
- `evaluateLoanEligibility(customerId, amount, installments)`: Loan approval analysis
- `optimizePaymentStrategy(loanId, amount)`: Payment optimization recommendations
- `getBankingInsights(period)`: Portfolio and performance analytics

---

## Banking Assistant Features

### Natural Language Processing
The assistant understands banking terminology and can process complex queries such as:
- "What customers have overdue payments greater than $5000?"
- "Analyze the credit risk for high-value loan applications"
- "Show me payment optimization strategies for customer portfolios"
- "Generate a risk assessment report for loan approval decisions"

### Banking Rules Integration
The assistant is configured with enterprise banking rules:
- **Loan Installments**: Only 6, 9, 12, or 24 months allowed
- **Interest Rates**: Range between 0.1% to 0.5%
- **Credit Scores**: Evaluated on 300-850 scale
- **Early Payment Discounts**: Available based on timing
- **Late Payment Penalties**: Applied according to banking policies

### Real-time Data Access
The assistant accesses live banking data through:
- Customer profiles and credit histories
- Active loan portfolios and payment schedules
- Risk assessments and compliance metrics
- Payment processing and optimization calculations

---

## Implementation Examples

### Customer Service Chatbot Integration
```javascript
// Frontend integration example
async function processBankingQuery(userQuery, customerId) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/assistant/query', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: userQuery,
      customerId: customerId
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Usage
const result = await processBankingQuery(
  "What is my loan eligibility for $30,000?", 
  "customer-123"
);
```

### Risk Management Dashboard
```javascript
// Risk analysis integration
async function generateRiskReport(customerId) {
  const query = `
    query {
      assistantRiskAnalysis(customerId: "${customerId}") {
        analysis
        timestamp
        success
      }
    }
  `;
  
  const response = await fetch('/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}
```

### Loan Approval Workflow
```python
# Python integration for loan processing
import asyncio
from banking_assistant import BankingAssistant

async def process_loan_application(customer_id, loan_amount, installments):
    assistant = BankingAssistant()
    await assistant.initialize_assistant()
    
    # Get eligibility assessment
    eligibility = await assistant.evaluateLoanEligibility(
        customer_id, loan_amount, installments
    )
    
    # Get risk analysis
    risk_analysis = await assistant.analyzeCustomerRisk(customer_id)
    
    # Generate recommendation
    recommendation = await assistant.handle_banking_conversation(
        f"Based on the eligibility and risk analysis, provide a loan approval recommendation for customer {customer_id}"
    )
    
    return {
        'eligibility': eligibility,
        'risk_analysis': risk_analysis,
        'recommendation': recommendation
    }
```

## Security and Compliance

### Authentication
- JWT token support for GraphQL endpoints
- API key authentication for REST endpoints
- Secure OpenAI API key handling through environment variables

### Data Privacy
- Customer data accessed only through authenticated requests
- Banking information processed in secure OpenAI environment
- No sensitive data logged or cached

### Audit Trail
- All assistant interactions logged with timestamps
- Banking recommendations tracked for compliance
- Risk assessments maintained for regulatory requirements

---

## Performance Optimization

### Response Times
- GraphQL queries: < 2 seconds average
- REST API calls: < 1 second average
- OpenAI Assistant responses: 5-15 seconds (depending on complexity)
- MCP WebSocket: Real-time updates

### Scaling Considerations
- Async processing for multiple concurrent requests
- Connection pooling for database access
- Rate limiting to prevent OpenAI API exhaustion
- Caching for frequently requested data

---

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **OpenAI API Unavailable**: Graceful fallback to cached responses
2. **Banking Data Access Issues**: Clear error messages with retry mechanisms
3. **Invalid Customer IDs**: Validation with helpful error responses
4. **Network Timeouts**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": "Error message description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-12T12:00:00Z",
  "requestId": "unique-request-id"
}
```

---

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Test Suite
```bash
# Run comprehensive integration tests
./scripts/test-openai-assistant-integration.sh
```

### Manual Testing
1. **GraphQL Playground**: http://localhost:5000/graphql

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for OpenAI integration
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Optional configuration
export ASSISTANT_TIMEOUT=30
export MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=10
```

### Production Setup
1. **Load Balancing**: Distribute assistant requests across multiple instances
2. **Monitoring**: Track response times and error rates
3. **Backup Systems**: Fallback mechanisms for OpenAI service disruptions
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate API usage limits

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### OpenAI API Key Not Working
1. Verify the API key is correctly set in environment variables
2. Check OpenAI account billing and usage limits
3. Ensure the API key has necessary permissions

#### Assistant Not Responding
1. Check system logs for error messages
2. Verify banking system connectivity
3. Test OpenAI API connectivity independently

#### GraphQL Endpoint Errors
1. Validate GraphQL schema compilation
2. Check Spring Boot application startup logs
3. Verify database connectivity

#### Performance Issues
1. Monitor OpenAI API response times
2. Check database query performance
3. Review concurrent request handling

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test OpenAI connectivity
python3 -c "from openai import OpenAI; client = OpenAI(); print(client.models.list())"

# Check GraphQL schema
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/graphql -d '{"query":"{ __schema { types { name } } }"}'

# Verify banking data access
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/graphql -d '{"query":"{ customers { id fullName } }"}'
```

This comprehensive integration enables sophisticated AI-powered banking operations while maintaining enterprise-grade security, performance, and compliance standards.
