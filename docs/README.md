# Enterprise Loan Management System Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Enterprise Loan Management System. This system is built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Hexagonal Architecture patterns to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for managing enterprise loans.

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

### Bounded Contexts

The system is organized into three main bounded contexts:

1. **Customer Management** - Handles customer data and credit limit management
2. **Loan Origination** - Manages loan creation and installment scheduling
3. **Payment Processing** - Handles payment processing and calculations

### Key Features

- **Loan Creation** with business rule validation
- **Payment Processing** with early/late payment calculations
- **Credit Management** with automatic limit updates
- **Role-Based Access Control** (ADMIN and CUSTOMER roles)
- **Event-Driven Architecture** with SAGA pattern implementation
- **Real-time notifications** through domain events

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Gradle 8.0+

### Quick Start

1. **Start Infrastructure Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
