## 🚀 Development Strategy Going Forward

### Recommended PR Workflow
1. **Small, Focused PRs**: Limit changes to specific features/fixes
2. **Single Branch Updates**: Avoid cross-branch merging
3. **Pre-merge Testing**: Test compilation and basic functionality
4. **Security Review**: Ensure new changes don't violate .gitignore patterns

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Primary production branch ✅
- **v2**: Enhanced features branch ✅  
- **Feature branches**: Create from specific target branch
- **Hotfixes**: Direct to target branch with minimal changes

### CI/CD Improvements Needed
```yaml
# GitHub Secrets to add:
secrets:
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: "<webhook-url>"
  SMTP_SERVER: "<smtp-server>"
  NOTIFICATION_EMAIL: "<admin-email>"
```
