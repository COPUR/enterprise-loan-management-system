- Data masking and tokenization
- Privacy-preserving analytics

#### DP4: Data Interoperability
**Statement**: Data must be accessible and usable across systems and boundaries.
**Rationale**: Siloed data limits business value and innovation.
**Implications**:
- Standardized data formats
- Open API specifications
- Event-driven data sharing
- Cross-platform data models

### 3. Application Architecture Principles

#### AP1: Service-Oriented Architecture

**Rationale**: Services enable flexibility, reusability, and independent scaling.
**Implications**:
- Microservices with bounded contexts
- Domain-driven design principles
- Service mesh for communication
- Independent deployment capabilities

#### AP2: API-First Development
**Statement**: APIs are designed before implementation and treated as first-class products.
**Rationale**: Well-designed APIs enable ecosystem growth and partner integration.
**Implications**:
- OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- FAPI 2.0 security standards
- Versioning and deprecation policies
- Developer portal and documentation

#### AP3: Cloud-Native Design
**Statement**: Applications are designed to leverage cloud capabilities fully.
**Rationale**: Cloud-native approaches provide scalability, resilience, and cost efficiency.
**Implications**:
- Containerized deployments
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Serverless where appropriate

#### AP4: Continuous Evolution
**Statement**: Applications must support continuous improvement and deployment.
**Rationale**: Rapid iteration enables faster time-to-market and quality improvements.
**Implications**:
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Blue-green deployments
- Feature toggles
- Automated testing

### 4. Technology Architecture Principles

#### TP1: Standards-Based Technology
**Statement**: Use industry standards and avoid proprietary solutions where possible.
**Rationale**: Standards ensure interoperability, skills availability, and longevity.
**Implications**:
- Open source preference
- Industry protocol adoption
- Standard security frameworks
- Common integration patterns

#### TP2: Security as Foundation
**Statement**: Security is built into every layer of the technology stack.
**Rationale**: Financial systems are high-value targets requiring comprehensive protection.
**Implications**:
- Zero-trust architecture
- Defense in depth strategy
- Regular security assessments
- Automated security scanning

#### TP3: Scalability and Performance
**Statement**: Technology must scale horizontally and vertically to meet demand.
**Rationale**: Financial operations have variable loads requiring elastic capacity.
**Implications**:
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Database read replicas
- Caching strategies
- Performance monitoring

#### TP4: Operational Excellence
**Statement**: Technology choices must consider operational maintainability.
**Rationale**: Operational efficiency reduces costs and improves reliability.
**Implications**:
- Infrastructure as code
- Automated monitoring
- Self-healing systems
- Comprehensive logging

### 5. Integration Architecture Principles

#### IP1: Loose Coupling
**Statement**: Systems integrate through well-defined interfaces with minimal dependencies.
**Rationale**: Loose coupling enables independent evolution and reduces cascading failures.
**Implications**:
- Event-driven architecture
- Message-based communication
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Asynchronous processing

#### IP2: Standards-Based Integration
**Statement**: Use industry-standard protocols and formats for integration.
**Rationale**: Standards simplify integration and reduce custom development.
**Implications**:
- RESTful APIs
- JSON/XML data formats
- OAuth 2.1 authentication
- Standard message formats
