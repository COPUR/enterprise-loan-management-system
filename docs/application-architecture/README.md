# Application Architecture

This section contains microservices design, API specifications, integration patterns, and sequence diagrams.

## Microservices
- [Component Diagram](microservices/component-diagram.puml) - System component relationships
- [Microservices Architecture](microservices/microservices-architecture-diagram.puml) - Service architecture design
- [Hexagonal Architecture](microservices/hexagonal-architecture.puml) - Ports and adapters pattern
- [Simple Architecture](microservices/simple-architecture.puml) - Simplified system view
- [Gradle 9 Microservices Upgrade Report](microservices/GRADLE_9_MICROSERVICES_UPGRADE_REPORT.md) - Modernization documentation

## API Specifications
- [OpenFinance API Documentation](api-specifications/OPENFINANCE_API_DOCUMENTATION.md) - RESTful API specifications

## Integration Patterns
