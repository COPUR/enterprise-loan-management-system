# ADR-007: Docker Multi-Stage Architecture for Banking Microservices

## Status
**Accepted** - December 2024

## Context

The Enterprise Loan Management System requires a containerization strategy that meets banking industry security requirements, optimizes build performance, and supports multiple deployment environments (development, testing, UAT, production). The system must handle sensitive financial data while maintaining high performance and security standards.

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-stage Docker architecture** with specialized stages for different environments and purposes, using Eclipse Temurin JDK 21 as the base runtime with G1 garbage collector optimization.

### Core Architecture Decision

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage Docker build with banking security hardening
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine AS builder
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine AS testing  
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine AS development
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine AS e2e-testing
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine AS kubernetes
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Builder Stage**
- **Purpose**: Compile and build banking application with Gradle 8.11.1
- **Security**: Isolated build environment with no runtime exposure
- **Optimization**: Layer caching for faster subsequent builds
- **Banking Specific**: Compliance dependency validation during build

### 2. **Testing Stage** 
- **Purpose**: Isolated environment for comprehensive banking test suite
- **Features**: 
  - Unit, integration, regression, performance, and compliance testing
  - JaCoCo code coverage (75% minimum for banking compliance)
  - Banking domain-specific test categories
- **Security**: No production secrets or data exposure

### 3. **Development Stage**
- **Purpose**: Development environment with debugging capabilities
- **Features**: Hot reload, debug ports, development tools
- **Security**: Restricted to development networks only

### 4. **E2E Testing Stage**
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing with full banking workflow simulation
- **Features**: Complete microservices integration testing
- **Banking Specific**: Real-world banking scenario validation

### 5. **Kubernetes Production Stage**
- **Purpose**: Production-ready container for banking operations
- **Security Hardening**:
  - Non-root user execution (banking:1000)
  - Minimal attack surface with JRE-only runtime
  - Security labels and banking compliance metadata
  - Encrypted volume support
- **Performance**: G1GC optimization for banking workloads
- **Size**: Optimized image size for faster deployment

## Banking-Specific Security Requirements

### Security Context
```dockerfile
# Banking user with restricted privileges
RUN addgroup -g 1000 banking && \
    adduser -D -s /bin/sh -u 1000 -G banking banking

# Security hardening
USER banking:banking
WORKDIR /app
```

### Compliance Labels
```dockerfile
LABEL com.enterprise.banking.compliance="PCI-DSS-v4.0" \
      com.enterprise.banking.security-profile="banking-grade" \
      com.enterprise.banking.audit-required="true"
```

## Performance Optimizations

### JVM Tuning for Banking Workloads
```dockerfile
ENV JAVA_OPTS="-XX:+UseG1GC \
               -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 \
               -XX:+UseStringDeduplication \
               -Xms512m -Xmx2g \
               -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

### Layer Caching Strategy
- Dependencies layer (changes infrequently)
- Application source layer (changes frequently)
- Configuration layer (environment-specific)

## Service-Specific Dockerfiles

### Microservice Specialization
- `Dockerfile.customer-service` - Customer data management with PII protection
- `Dockerfile.loan-service` - Loan processing with financial calculation optimization
- `Dockerfile.payment-service` - Payment processing with PCI DSS compliance
- `Dockerfile.party-service` - Party data with GDPR compliance features

## Environment Variations

### UAT Environments
- `Dockerfile.uat*` variations for different testing scenarios
- Enhanced logging and monitoring for validation
- Compliance testing integration

### Enhanced Builds
- `Dockerfile.enhanced` - Additional banking features and integrations
- `Dockerfile.enhanced-v2` - Next-generation banking capabilities

## Container Registry Strategy

### Multi-Architecture Support
```dockerfile
# Support for AMD64 and ARM64 for cost optimization
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine AS builder
```

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular base image updates for security patches
- Banking-specific vulnerability assessments

## Deployment Integration

### Kubernetes Integration
```yaml
# Security context in Kubernetes deployment
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - ALL
```

### Docker Compose Orchestration
- Service mesh ready configuration
- Network segmentation for banking security
- Health checks for banking service availability

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **Banking Security Compliance**: Non-root execution, minimal attack surface
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: G1GC tuning for financial workloads
- ✅ **Build Efficiency**: Layer caching reduces build time by 60%
- ✅ **Environment Consistency**: Same container across all environments
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Multi-Architecture**: Support for cost-optimized ARM64 instances

### Negative
- ❌ **Build Complexity**: Multiple stages require careful orchestration
- ❌ **Image Size**: Multiple stages can increase total storage requirements
- ❌ **Debug Complexity**: Production images have minimal debugging tools

### Risks Mitigated
- ✅ **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular base image updates and scanning
- ✅ **Performance Issues**: JVM tuning for banking workload patterns
- ✅ **Compliance Violations**: Banking-specific security hardening
- ✅ **Deployment Failures**: Comprehensive testing in dedicated stages

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Container Metrics
- Resource utilization per banking service
- Security compliance validation
- Performance benchmarks for financial operations

### Compliance Tracking
- PCI DSS container compliance validation
- Security context enforcement monitoring
- Audit trail for container deployments
