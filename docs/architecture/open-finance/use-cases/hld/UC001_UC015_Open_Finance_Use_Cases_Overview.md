# Open Finance Use Cases Architecture Overview (UC001-UC015)

## Common Architectural Principles (Applicable to All Use Cases)

Before detailing each use case, note that they all share a common Open Finance architectural pattern:

* **Security:** OAuth 2.1 / OIDC with FAPI 2.0 controls (DPoP-bound tokens, PAR, PKCE, mTLS, required FAPI interaction headers).
* **Actors:** PSU (Payment Service User), TPP (Third Party Provider), ASPSP (Account Servicing Payment Service Provider).
* **Core Components:** API Gateway, Consent Manager, Identity Provider (IdP), and backend resource services.
* **Data Pattern:** PostgreSQL as transactional/event source of truth, Redis for low-latency controls/caching, MongoDB as analytics silver copy where required.
* **API Baseline:** Resource calls require `Authorization: DPoP <token>`, `DPoP`, and `X-FAPI-Interaction-ID`; write calls also require idempotency keys.

## 1. UC001: Personal Financial Management (Personal Banking Data)

**Description:** Enables retail customers to share their account balances and transaction history with TPPs for budgeting and analytics.

**System Architecture & Modules:**

* **Consent Module:** Handles the granular permissions for "ReadAccounts", "ReadBalances", and "ReadTransactions".
* **Account Information Service (AIS):** Retrieves read-only data from the Core Banking System.

**Data Flow:**

1. TPP requests account access consent.
2. User authenticates and authorizes specific permissions.
3. TPP exchanges auth code for Access Token.
4. TPP requests `/accounts`, `/balances`, or `/transactions` using the token.

**API Signature:**

```http
POST /account-access-consents
GET  /account-access-consents/{ConsentId}
GET  /accounts
GET  /accounts/{AccountId}
GET  /accounts/{AccountId}/balances
GET  /accounts/{AccountId}/transactions
GET  /accounts/{AccountId}/beneficiaries
GET  /accounts/{AccountId}/direct-debits
GET  /accounts/{AccountId}/standing-orders
```

**Postman Collection Structure:**
