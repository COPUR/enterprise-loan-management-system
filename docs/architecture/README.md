- **Updated POM.xml** with comprehensive dependency management
- **Added version management** for all framework and library versions
- **Organized dependencies** by category (Framework, Database, Security, etc.)

###  2. Configuration Extraction
- **Identified 50+ hardcoded configurations** in Java classes
- **Converted to environment variables** with sensible defaults
- **Updated main application.yml** with externalized configuration
- **Maintained environment-specific** configurations for DEV, SIT, UAT

###  3. Environment Configuration Cleanup
- **Removed preprod and prod** configuration files as requested
- **Kept only DEV, SIT, UAT** environments
- **Standardized configuration patterns** across environments
- **Enhanced security** by externalizing sensitive values

### 4. Architecture Documentation
Created comprehensive architecture diagrams:
- **System Context Diagram** - External system relationships
- **Component Diagram** - Internal component structure  
- **Hexagonal Architecture Diagram** - Ports and adapters pattern
- **Deployment Diagram** - Infrastructure and deployment topology

### 5. Comprehensive Analysis Document
- **Configuration Analysis** - Complete breakdown of extracted values
- **Java Class Analysis** - Domain, application, and infrastructure components
- **Security and Compliance** - FAPI and banking security features
- **AI Integration Analysis** - Spring AI and MCP implementation
