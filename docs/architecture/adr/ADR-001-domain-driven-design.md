## Context

Complex enterprise loan management systems require sophisticated architectural approaches to handle intricate business rules, multiple user personas, and complex financial processes. Based on extensive experience implementing domain-driven architectures for major financial institutions, this decision establishes Domain-Driven Design principles as the foundation for maintainable, scalable, and business-aligned system architecture.

Traditional layered architectures in banking systems consistently lead to:
- Business logic fragmentation across multiple technical layers
- Tight coupling between infrastructure and business concerns
- Difficulty expressing complex financial business rules and regulatory requirements
- Communication gaps between business domain experts and technical teams
- Monolithic designs that resist evolution and regulatory change

## Decision

We will implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as our core architectural approach for the Loan Management System.

### Key DDD Concepts Implemented

#### 1. Bounded Contexts
We have identified three primary bounded contexts:

- **Customer Management Context**: Responsible for customer data and credit limit management
- **Loan Origination Context**: Handles loan creation, validation, and installment scheduling
- **Payment Processing Context**: Manages payment processing, calculations, and loan completion

#### 2. Domain Model
Each bounded context has its own rich domain model with:

- **Aggregates**: Customer, Loan, Payment
- **Entities**: Customer, Loan, LoanInstallment, Payment
- **Value Objects**: Money, InterestRate, InstallmentCount, CustomerId, LoanId, PaymentId
- **Domain Events**: LoanCreated, PaymentProcessed, CreditReserved, CreditReleased

#### 3. Ubiquitous Language
We maintain a shared vocabulary between business and technical teams:

- **Principal**: The original loan amount before interest
- **Total Amount**: Principal + Interest (principal Ã— (1 + interest rate))
- **Installment**: A scheduled payment with specific due date
- **Early Payment Discount**: Reduction based on days paid before due date
- **Late Payment Penalty**: Additional charge based on days paid after due date
- **Credit Reservation**: Temporary allocation of credit limit for loan processing

#### 4. Domain Services
Business logic that doesn't naturally fit in a single aggregate:

- **CreditAssessmentService**: Evaluates customer eligibility for loans
- **PaymentCalculationService**: Calculates payment schedules, discounts, and penalties

#### 5. Domain Events
Events that represent important business occurrences:

```java
// Customer Management Events
- CreditReserved
- CreditReleased
- CreditReservationFailed

// Loan Origination Events
- LoanApplicationSubmitted
- LoanCreated

// Payment Processing Events
- PaymentInitiated
- PaymentProcessed
- LoanFullyPaid
