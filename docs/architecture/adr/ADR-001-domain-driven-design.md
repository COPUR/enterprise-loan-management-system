## Context

We need to build a complex enterprise loan management system that can handle various business rules, multiple user types, and complex business processes. The system needs to be maintainable, scalable, and adaptable to changing business requirements.

Traditional layered architectures often lead to:
- Business logic scattered across multiple layers
- Tight coupling between technical and business concerns
- Difficulty in expressing complex business rules
- Poor communication between technical and business teams
- Monolithic designs that are hard to evolve

## Decision

We will implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as our core architectural approach for the Loan Management System.

### Key DDD Concepts Implemented

#### 1. Bounded Contexts
We have identified three primary bounded contexts:

- **Customer Management Context**: Responsible for customer data and credit limit management
- **Loan Origination Context**: Handles loan creation, validation, and installment scheduling
- **Payment Processing Context**: Manages payment processing, calculations, and loan completion

#### 2. Domain Model
Each bounded context has its own rich domain model with:

- **Aggregates**: Customer, Loan, Payment
- **Entities**: Customer, Loan, LoanInstallment, Payment
- **Value Objects**: Money, InterestRate, InstallmentCount, CustomerId, LoanId, PaymentId
- **Domain Events**: LoanCreated, PaymentProcessed, CreditReserved, CreditReleased

#### 3. Ubiquitous Language
We maintain a shared vocabulary between business and technical teams:

- **Principal**: The original loan amount before interest
- **Total Amount**: Principal + Interest (principal Ã— (1 + interest rate))
- **Installment**: A scheduled payment with specific due date
- **Early Payment Discount**: Reduction based on days paid before due date
- **Late Payment Penalty**: Additional charge based on days paid after due date
- **Credit Reservation**: Temporary allocation of credit limit for loan processing

#### 4. Domain Services
Business logic that doesn't naturally fit in a single aggregate:

- **CreditAssessmentService**: Evaluates customer eligibility for loans
- **PaymentCalculationService**: Calculates payment schedules, discounts, and penalties

#### 5. Domain Events
Events that represent important business occurrences:

```java
// Customer Management Events
- CreditReserved
- CreditReleased
- CreditReservationFailed

// Loan Origination Events
- LoanApplicationSubmitted
- LoanCreated

// Payment Processing Events
- PaymentInitiated
- PaymentProcessed
- LoanFullyPaid
