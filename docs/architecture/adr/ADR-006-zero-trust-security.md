# ADR-006: Zero-Trust Security Architecture

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implemented December 2024

## Context

The Enhanced Enterprise Banking System requires a comprehensive security architecture that assumes no implicit trust within the network perimeter. Modern banking systems face sophisticated threats that require defense-in-depth strategies with continuous verification of every transaction, user, and device.

### Current Security Challenges
- **Legacy Perimeter Security**: Traditional castle-and-moat security models are insufficient
- **Insider Threats**: Need protection against malicious or compromised internal actors
- **Lateral Movement**: Prevention of threat propagation within the network
- **Compliance Requirements**: Strict regulatory requirements for financial services
- **Cloud-Native Challenges**: Dynamic, distributed environments require new security approaches
- **API Security**: Extensive API surface area requires comprehensive protection

### Regulatory and Compliance Requirements
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance for financial reporting
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation for data privacy
- **FAPI**: Financial-grade API security requirements
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management guidelines
- **FFIEC Guidelines**: Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidance

### Business Requirements
- Protect customer financial data and personal information
- Ensure business continuity and system availability
- Maintain regulatory compliance and pass audits
- Support digital transformation initiatives securely
- Enable secure remote work and third-party integrations
- Provide comprehensive audit trails for investigations

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **Zero-Trust Security Architecture** across the Enhanced Enterprise Banking System, incorporating multiple layers of security controls and continuous verification principles.

### Core Zero-Trust Principles

#### 1. Never Trust, Always Verify
- Every user, device, and network flow must be authenticated and authorized
- Continuous verification throughout the session lifecycle
- No implicit trust based on network location or previous authentication

#### 2. Least Privilege Access
- Minimum necessary permissions for users and services
- Just-in-time access provisioning
- Regular access reviews and recertification

#### 3. Assume Breach
- Design systems assuming attackers have already gained access
- Implement detection and response capabilities
- Limit blast radius through segmentation

#### 4. Verify Explicitly
- Use multiple sources of data for access decisions
- Combine identity, device, location, and behavioral signals
- Real-time risk assessment for access decisions
