## Context

Domain-Driven Design implementation for enterprise banking systems requires architectural patterns that ensure complete isolation of business logic from infrastructure concerns. Based on extensive experience implementing hexagonal architecture patterns across multiple financial institutions, this decision establishes the Ports and Adapters pattern as essential for maintaining business logic purity and enabling comprehensive testing strategies.

Banking system architecture demands patterns that:
- Achieve complete isolation of financial business logic from external infrastructure concerns
- Enable comprehensive testability by allowing business logic validation without infrastructure dependencies
- Provide architectural flexibility to adapt infrastructure components without impacting core business rules
- Support multiple interaction interfaces including REST APIs, messaging systems, and batch processing
- Facilitate long-term maintainability and system evolution under changing regulatory requirements

Traditional layered architectures in banking consistently demonstrate critical limitations:
- Business logic contamination with infrastructure and persistence concerns
- Testing complexity requiring full infrastructure stack for business logic validation
- Architectural rigidity where database or framework changes impact core business rules
- Risk propagation where infrastructure changes can introduce business logic defects

## Decision

We will implement Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters pattern) to structure our application layers and manage dependencies.
