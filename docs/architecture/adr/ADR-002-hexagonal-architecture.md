# ADR-002: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context

Our Domain-Driven Design implementation needs a architectural pattern that:
- Isolates business logic from external concerns
- Enables testability by allowing business logic to be tested in isolation
- Provides flexibility to change infrastructure components without affecting business logic
- Supports multiple interfaces (REST API, messaging, batch processing)
- Facilitates maintainability and evolution of the system

Traditional layered architectures have limitations:
- Business logic often becomes dependent on infrastructure concerns
- Difficult to test business logic without infrastructure dependencies
- Tight coupling between layers makes changes risky
- Database or framework changes can impact business logic

## Decision

We will implement Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters pattern) to structure our application layers and manage dependencies.
