# ADR-005: Istio Service Mesh for Zero-Trust Networking

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implemented December 2024

## Executive Summary

This Architecture Decision Record establishes Istio Service Mesh as the foundation for zero-trust networking in our enterprise banking platform. Based on proven experience implementing service mesh architectures in highly regulated financial environments, this decision addresses critical requirements for secure microservices communication, comprehensive observability, and regulatory compliance. The implementation leverages industry best practices for financial services infrastructure, incorporating mutual TLS encryption, fine-grained authorization policies, and comprehensive audit trails required for banking operations. This architectural choice positions the platform to meet evolving regulatory requirements while providing the operational flexibility needed for modern banking services.

## Context

The Enhanced Enterprise Banking System requires a sophisticated networking solution that can provide security, observability, and traffic management for microservices communication. The system must support:

- **Zero-trust networking** with mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service communication
- **Fine-grained traffic policies** for banking operations
- **Comprehensive observability** for compliance and monitoring
- **Service-to-service authentication and authorization**
- **Centralized security policy management**
- **High availability and resilience** for critical banking services
- **Regulatory compliance** with audit trails and security controls
- **Integration with OAuth 2.1** authentication system

### Current Challenges
- Complex microservices communication requires secure networking
- Need for centralized policy management across services
- Compliance requirements for encrypted communication
- Observability gaps in service-to-service interactions
- Difficulty implementing consistent security policies
- Network traffic management and load balancing complexity

### Requirements
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) encryption for all service communication
- JWT token validation at the network layer
- Fine-grained authorization policies
- Traffic management and load balancing
- Comprehensive metrics, logging, and tracing
- Integration with existing authentication systems
- Support for A/B testing and canary deployments
- Compliance with financial industry security standards

## Decision

We have decided to implement **Istio Service Mesh** as our networking and security infrastructure for the Enhanced Enterprise Banking System.

### Selected Solution: Istio Service Mesh

**Istio** provides a comprehensive service mesh solution with the following components:

#### Core Istio Components
1. **Istiod (Control Plane)**
   - Pilot: Traffic management and configuration
   - Citadel: Certificate management and security policies
   - Galley: Configuration validation and distribution

2. **Envoy Proxy (Data Plane)**
   - Sidecar proxies for all microservices
   - Traffic interception and routing
   - Security policy enforcement
   - Observability data collection

3. **Gateways**
   - Ingress Gateway: External traffic entry point
   - Egress Gateway: External service communication

## Security Features

### 1. Zero-Trust Implementation
- **No Implicit Trust**: Every service communication requires authentication
- **Identity Verification**: Service identity validation using X.509 certificates
- **Least Privilege**: Fine-grained authorization policies
- **Continuous Verification**: Real-time security policy enforcement

### 2. Certificate Management
- **Automatic Provisioning**: Istio automatically issues certificates for workloads
- **Certificate Rotation**: Automatic certificate renewal (24-hour default)
- **Root CA Management**: Secure root certificate management
- **Cross-Cluster Trust**: Support for multi-cluster certificate trust

### 3. Network Segmentation
- **Namespace Isolation**: Network policies based on Kubernetes namespaces
- **Service-to-Service Policies**: Fine-grained communication rules
- **Ingress/Egress Control**: Controlled external communication
- **Default Deny**: Implicit deny for all communication without explicit policies

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- Service-to-service communication latency and throughput
- mTLS handshake success/failure rates
