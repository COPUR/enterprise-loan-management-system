## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Security Model

![Security Architecture](../../images/Enhanced%20Enterprise%20Banking%20Security%20Architecture.svg)

#### Security Layers

1. **Perimeter Security**
   - Istio Ingress Gateway with TLS 1.3 termination
   - OAuth2 Proxy for authentication
   - DDoS protection and rate limiting

2. **Identity & Access Management**
   - Keycloak OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - LDAP/Active Directory integration

3. **Service Mesh Security**
   - Envoy sidecars for every microservice
   - Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service communication
   - JWT token validation at mesh level
   - Fine-grained authorization policies

4. **Application Security**
   - OWASP Top 10 protection
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS attack mitigation

#### Authentication Flow

    private LoanId id;
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private Money principalAmount;
    private LoanStatus status;
    private List<DomainEvent> domainEvents;
    
    // Factory method for controlled creation

        Loan loan = new Loan(command);
        loan.addDomainEvent(new LoanApplicationSubmittedEvent(loan));
        return loan;
    }
    
    // Pure business logic
    public void approve(String approvedBy) {
        if (this.status != LoanStatus.PENDING) {
            throw new LoanBusinessException("Only pending loans can be approved");
        }
        this.status = LoanStatus.APPROVED;
        addDomainEvent(new LoanApprovedEvent(this));
    }
}

// Application Layer - Use Case Orchestration
@ApplicationService
@Transactional
public class LoanApplicationService {
    
    @Autowired
    private LoanRepository loanRepository; // Port
    
    @Autowired
    private DomainEventPublisher eventPublisher; // Port
    
    public LoanApplicationResult createLoan(CreateLoanCommand command) {
        // Domain validation and creation
        Loan loan = Loan.create(command);
        
        // Persistence through port
        loanRepository.save(loan);
        
        // Event publishing
        eventPublisher.publishEvents(loan.getDomainEvents());
        
        return LoanApplicationResult.success(loan.getId());
    }
}

# ADR-001: OAuth 2.1 with Keycloak for Authentication

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need for enterprise-grade authentication and authorization system that supports:
- Financial-grade API (FAPI) compliance
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication
- External identity provider integration

## Decision
Implement OAuth 2.1 with Keycloak as the identity and access management solution.

## Consequences
### Positive
- FAPI 1.0 Advanced compliance
- Centralized identity management
- Strong security with PKCE
- Extensive enterprise integrations

### Negative
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Learning curve for development team
- Dependency on external service

## Implementation
- Keycloak deployed in high-availability mode
- Banking-specific realm configuration
- Integration with existing LDAP/AD systems
- Custom themes for banking branding
```
