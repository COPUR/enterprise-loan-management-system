## üîê Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Security Model

![Security Architecture](docs/images/Enhanced%20Enterprise%20Banking%20Security%20Architecture.svg)

#### Security Layers

1. **Perimeter Security**
   - Istio Ingress Gateway with TLS 1.3 termination
   - OAuth2 Proxy for authentication
   - DDoS protection and rate limiting

2. **Identity & Access Management**
   - Keycloak OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - LDAP/Active Directory integration

3. **Service Mesh Security**
   - Envoy sidecars for every microservice
   - Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service communication
   - JWT token validation at mesh level
   - Fine-grained authorization policies

4. **Application Security**
   - OWASP Top 10 protection
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS attack mitigation

#### Authentication Flow

## üè¶ Domain Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design Implementation

![Hexagonal Architecture](docs/images/Enhanced%20Enterprise%20Banking%20-%20Hexagonal%20Architecture.svg)

#### Bounded Contexts

| Context | Description | Key Aggregates | Domain Events |
|---------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Customer Management** | Customer lifecycle and KYC | Customer, Account, Profile | CustomerCreated, KYCCompleted |
| **Loan Processing** | Loan lifecycle management | Loan, Application, Assessment | LoanApplied, LoanApproved, LoanDisbursed |
| **Payment Processing** | Payment transactions | Payment, Transaction, Transfer | PaymentInitiated, PaymentCompleted |
| **Risk Management** | Credit and operational risk | RiskProfile, CreditScore, Assessment | RiskAssessed, ScoreUpdated |

#### Hexagonal Architecture Layers

```java
// Domain Layer - Pure Business Logic
public class Loan extends AggregateRoot<LoanId> {
    private LoanId id;
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private Money principalAmount;
    private LoanStatus status;
    private List<DomainEvent> domainEvents;
    
    // Factory method for controlled creation
    public static Loan create(LoanCreationCommand command) {
        validateBusinessRules(command);
        Loan loan = new Loan(command);
        loan.addDomainEvent(new LoanApplicationSubmittedEvent(loan));
        return loan;
    }
    
    // Pure business logic
    public void approve(String approvedBy) {
        if (this.status != LoanStatus.PENDING) {
            throw new LoanBusinessException("Only pending loans can be approved");
        }
        this.status = LoanStatus.APPROVED;
        addDomainEvent(new LoanApprovedEvent(this));
    }
}

// Application Layer - Use Case Orchestration
@ApplicationService
@Transactional
public class LoanApplicationService {
    
    @Autowired
    private LoanRepository loanRepository; // Port
    
    @Autowired
    private DomainEventPublisher eventPublisher; // Port
    
    public LoanApplicationResult createLoan(CreateLoanCommand command) {
        // Domain validation and creation
        Loan loan = Loan.create(command);
        
        // Persistence through port
        loanRepository.save(loan);
        
        // Event publishing
        eventPublisher.publishEvents(loan.getDomainEvents());
        
        return LoanApplicationResult.success(loan.getId());
    }
}

// Infrastructure Layer - Adapters
@Repository
public class JpaLoanRepository implements LoanRepository {
    // JPA implementation details
}

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-001: OAuth 2.1 with Keycloak for Authentication

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need for enterprise-grade authentication and authorization system that supports:
- Financial-grade API (FAPI) compliance
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication
- External identity provider integration

## Decision
Implement OAuth 2.1 with Keycloak as the identity and access management solution.

## Consequences
### Positive
- FAPI 1.0 Advanced compliance
- Centralized identity management
- Strong security with PKCE
- Extensive enterprise integrations

### Negative
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Learning curve for development team
- Dependency on external service

## Implementation
- Keycloak deployed in high-availability mode
- Banking-specific realm configuration
- Integration with existing LDAP/AD systems
- Custom themes for banking branding
```
