## 🏗️ System Architecture Analysis

### Core Architecture Patterns

#### 1. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services coordinating domain objects
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Adapters for databases, web frameworks, and external services
- **Ports**: Well-defined interfaces between layers

#### 2. **Clean Architecture Principles**
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
- **Framework Independence**: Domain logic independent of frameworks

#### 3. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear separation between loan, customer, payment, and AI domains
- **Aggregates**: Loan, Customer, Payment aggregates with strong consistency boundaries
- **Value Objects**: Money, LoanAmount, InterestRate, CreditScore
- **Domain Events**: LoanCreatedEvent, PaymentProcessedEvent, CreditReleasedEvent
