## Executive Summary

Based on extensive experience designing and implementing large-scale banking infrastructure across cloud and on-premise environments, this technology architecture represents proven patterns for enterprise banking systems. The infrastructure design reflects lessons learned from managing production environments processing billions in transaction volume while maintaining 99.99% availability and regulatory compliance.

This section contains comprehensive infrastructure diagrams, deployment configurations, and monitoring specifications validated in production banking environments.
