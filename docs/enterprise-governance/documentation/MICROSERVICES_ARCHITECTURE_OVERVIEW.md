# Microservices Architecture Overview
## Enterprise Loan Management System

### Executive Summary

This document presents the comprehensive microservices architecture for our Enterprise Loan Management System, designed with over 15 years of banking systems engineering expertise. The architecture transformation from monolithic to microservices represents a strategic evolution toward scalable, resilient, and compliant banking operations. Built on proven financial services patterns, this ecosystem implements domain-driven design principles with strict adherence to regulatory requirements including PCI DSS, SOX, and emerging FAPI standards. The modular architecture enables rapid feature delivery while maintaining the reliability and security standards essential for banking operations.

### System Architecture

The Enterprise Loan Management System has been transformed from a monolithic architecture to a comprehensive microservices ecosystem with the following key components:

#### Core Architecture Principles
- **Microservices with Hexagonal Design**: Each service implements hexagonal architecture with clear domain boundaries
- **Database per Service**: Complete isolation with dedicated schemas for each microservice
- **Event Driven Architecture**: SAGA patterns for distributed transaction management
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Security by Design**: OWASP Top 10 compliance integrated at every layer

### Microservice Breakdown

#### 1. Customer Management Service
**Port**: 8081 | **Database**: `customer_db`

**Responsibilities**:
- Customer profile management and validation
- Credit limit administration and tracking
- Credit reservation/release for distributed transactions
- Account status lifecycle management

**Key Domain Objects**:
- `Customer`: Core customer entity with credit management
- `CreditReservation`: Temporary credit holds for loan processing
- `AccountStatus`: Customer account state tracking

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/v1/customers              # Create customer
GET    /api/v1/customers/{id}         # Get customer details
POST   /api/v1/customers/{id}/credit/reserve  # Reserve credit
POST   /api/v1/customers/{id}/credit/release  # Release credit
```

#### 2. Loan Origination Service
**Port**: 8082 | **Database**: `loan_db`

**Responsibilities**:
- Loan application processing and validation
- Business rule enforcement (installments: 6,9,12,24; interest: 0.1-0.5%)
- Installment schedule generation and management
- Loan lifecycle state management

**Key Domain Objects**:
- `Loan`: Primary loan entity with business rules
- `LoanInstallment`: Individual payment schedule entries
- `LoanApplication`: Application workflow management

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/v1/loans                  # Create loan application
GET    /api/v1/loans/{id}             # Get loan details
GET    /api/v1/loans/customer/{id}    # Get customer loans
GET    /api/v1/loans/{id}/installments # Get installment schedule
```

#### 3. Payment Processing Service
**Port**: 8083 | **Database**: `payment_db`

**Responsibilities**:
- Payment processing with business rule validation
- Early payment discount calculation (0.001 per day)
- Late payment penalty calculation (0.001 per day)
- Multi-installment payment distribution
- Payment history and transaction tracking

**Key Domain Objects**:
- `Payment`: Payment transaction entity
- `PaymentInstallment`: Individual installment payment records
- `PaymentCalculation`: Discount/penalty calculation logic

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/v1/payments/{loanId}      # Process payment
GET    /api/v1/payments/{paymentId}   # Get payment details
GET    /api/v1/payments/customer/{id} # Get customer payments
GET    /api/v1/payments/loan/{id}     # Get loan payment history
```

#### 4. API Gateway Service
**Port**: 8080 | **Database**: `banking_gateway`

**Responsibilities**:
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and Circuit Breaker patterns
- SAGA orchestration and state management
- Security audit logging

**Key Components**:
- `RedisIntegratedAPIGateway`: Main gateway with Redis integration
- `OWASPSecurityCompliance`: Security filter implementations
- `LoanCreationSagaOrchestrator`: Distributed transaction coordination

### Database Isolation Strategy

#### Customer Database (`customer_db`)
```sql
Tables:
- customers: Customer profiles and credit limits
- credit_reservations: Temporary credit holds
- account_status_history: Status change audit trail
```

#### Loan Database (`loan_db`)
```sql
Tables:
- loans: Loan entities and business data
- loan_installments: Payment schedule and status
- loan_applications: Application workflow state
```

#### Payment Database (`payment_db`)
```sql
Tables:
- payments: Payment transaction records
- payment_installments: Installment-level payment details
- payment_history: Comprehensive transaction log
```

#### Gateway Database (`banking_gateway`)
```sql
Tables:
- saga_states: Distributed transaction state
- audit_events: Security and operational logs
- session_data: User session management
```

### Event Driven Architecture

#### Event Streaming with Apache Kafka

**Topics Structure**:
- `customer-events`: Customer lifecycle and credit events
- `loan-events`: Loan creation and status updates
- `payment-events`: Payment processing and completion
- `credit-events`: Credit reservation and release
- `saga-events`: SAGA orchestration commands and events

#### SAGA Pattern Implementation

**Loan Creation SAGA Workflow**:
1. **Validate Customer**: Verify customer exists and is active
2. **Reserve Credit**: Check and reserve required credit amount
3. **Create Loan**: Generate loan entity with business rules
4. **Generate Installments**: Create payment schedule
5. **Complete Transaction**: Publish success event

**Compensation Patterns**:
- Automatic timeout detection (5-minute threshold)
- Credit release on loan creation failure
- Application cancellation on validation failure
- Event-driven rollback mechanisms

### Security Architecture
