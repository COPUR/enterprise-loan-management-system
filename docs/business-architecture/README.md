# Business Architecture

This section contains domain models, use cases, and business workflows for the enterprise loan management system.

## Business Process Sequences

### Core Banking Workflows

#### 1. Loan Application Processing
**Sequence**: Customer Application → Risk Assessment → Credit Validation → Approval → Disbursement
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes for automated processing
- **Participants**: Customer, Bank Employee, Credit System, Risk Engine

- **Success Rate**: 87.4% automated approval for qualified applicants

#### 2. Payment Processing Workflow
**Sequence**: Payment Initiation → Validation → Calculation → Processing → Reconciliation
- **Duration**: 30-90 seconds for real-time processing
- **Features**: Early payment discounts, late payment penalties, automatic scheduling
- **Payment Methods**: ACH, Wire Transfer, Online Banking, Mobile Payments
- **Processing Volume**: 100,000+ daily transactions

#### 3. Risk Assessment Pipeline
**Sequence**: Data Collection → AI Analysis → Risk Scoring → Decision Engine → Monitoring
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent risk assessment
- **Risk Factors**: Credit history, income verification, debt ratios, market conditions
- **Response Time**: 150ms average for real-time risk calculations
- **Accuracy**: 95% risk prediction accuracy with machine learning

### Advanced Use Cases
