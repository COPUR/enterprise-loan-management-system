## 1. Architecture Vision

### 1.1 Business Context

The financial services industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Traditional lending processes, built on decades-old systems, cannot meet the demands of modern consumers or the pace of regulatory change. Our architecture vision addresses these challenges through a platform that combines banking domain expertise with modern technology practices.

### 1.2 Strategic Drivers

**Market Forces**
- Digital-native competitors capturing market share
- Customer expectations shaped by consumer technology experiences
- Regulatory complexity increasing globally
- Margin compression requiring operational efficiency

**Technology Trends**
- Cloud-native architectures becoming standard
- Real-time processing expected by default
- Security threats evolving rapidly
- Data privacy regulations tightening

### 1.3 Architecture Goals

1. **Business Agility** - Deploy new products and features in weeks, not quarters
2. **Operational Excellence** - Achieve 99.99% availability with sub-second response times
3. **Security & Compliance** - Meet and exceed regulatory requirements by design
4. **Scalability** - Handle 10x growth without architectural changes
5. **Cost Optimization** - Reduce total cost of ownership by 40%
