## 4. Key Architecture Decisions

### ADR Registry
1. [ADR-001: Domain-Driven Design](architecture/adr/ADR-001-domain-driven-design.md)
2. [ADR-002: Hexagonal Architecture](architecture/adr/ADR-002-hexagonal-architecture.md)
3. [ADR-003: Saga Pattern](architecture/adr/ADR-003-saga-pattern.md)

### Technology Standards
- **Language**: Java 21 LTS
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.4.3
- **Architecture**: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)
- **Security**: OAuth 2.1 + FAPI 2.0 + DPoP
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes + Istio

## 5. Governance & Compliance

### Architecture Principles
1. **Business Alignment** - Technology serves business objectives
2. **Security by Design** - Built-in security, not bolted on
3. **Cloud Native** - Designed for elastic scale
4. **API First** - All capabilities exposed as services
5. **Event Driven** - Loosely coupled, highly cohesive

### Compliance Frameworks
- **FAPI 2.0** - Financial-grade API security
- **PCI DSS** - Payment card data protection
- **SOC 2** - Service organization controls
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management

### Review Processes
- Monthly Architecture Review Board
- Quarterly compliance assessments
- Continuous security monitoring
- Automated policy enforcement
