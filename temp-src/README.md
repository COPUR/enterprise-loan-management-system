# Temp Source Policy

This directory is frozen by default.

`temp-src/` exists only for controlled migration scenarios and must not receive new feature work.

Any non-policy update requires:

1. Architecture approval.
2. Migration plan and rollback notes in the PR.
3. Follow-up task to move code into canonical module locations.
