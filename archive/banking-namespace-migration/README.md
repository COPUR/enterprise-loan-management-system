# Banking Namespace Migration Archive

This directory contains the legacy `com.banking.*` namespace code that was migrated during the namespace consolidation effort.

## Migration Timeline

**Migration Date**: December 2024
**Reason**: Consolidate duplicate namespaces to single `com.bank.loanmanagement.*` structure
**Status**: In Progress

## Architecture Decision

The system had duplicate namespaces:
- `com.bank.loanmanagement.*` - Primary/Current implementation (Active)
- `com.banking.*` - Legacy/Alternative implementation (Archived)

The migration consolidates to the primary namespace for:
- ✅ Consistent architecture across the system
- ✅ Proper DDD bounded context organization  
- ✅ Simplified dependency management
- ✅ Reduced technical debt

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Dependencies (High Risk)
- [x] Analyze cross-namespace dependencies
- [x] Migrate CreditScore value object
- [x] Update import statements  
- [x] Test compilation

### Phase 2: REST API Consolidation (Medium Risk)
- [ ] Migrate LoanController
- [ ] Maintain API compatibility
- [ ] Update endpoint documentation

### Phase 3: Domain Model Consolidation (Low-Medium Risk)
- [ ] Evaluate duplicate domain models
- [ ] Merge unique business logic
- [ ] Archive duplicate implementations

### Phase 4: Archive Isolated Components (Low Risk)
- [ ] Archive Party Management classes
- [ ] Archive experimental code
- [ ] Clean up unused dependencies

### Phase 5: Test Migration (Low Risk)
- [ ] Migrate functional tests
- [ ] Update package references
- [ ] Validate test coverage

## Archived Components

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Critical Dependencies Resolved
**Migrated**: `com.banking.loan.domain.valueobjects.CreditScore`  
**To**: `com.bank.loanmanagement.domain.shared.CreditScore`  
**Date**: 2024-12  
**Impact**: Eliminated critical cross-namespace dependency that prevented clean architecture  
**Business Logic Enhanced**: Added 8+ new business methods for banking compliance  

### Critical Business Logic Preserved
- CreditScore calculation algorithms ✅ (Enhanced and migrated)
- Payment processing workflows  
- Risk assessment capabilities
- AI-enhanced loan analysis

### Archived as Duplicate/Legacy
- Alternative customer implementations
- Experimental party management
- Unused domain models
- Legacy test suites

## Recovery Instructions

If any archived code needs to be restored:

1. **Identify the specific component** in this archive
2. **Review the migration notes** for that component
3. **Copy to appropriate location** in main codebase
4. **Update package declarations** to current namespace
5. **Update import statements** throughout the system
6. **Run full test suite** to validate integration
