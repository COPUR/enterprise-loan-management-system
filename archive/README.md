# Archive Folder Policy

This directory is frozen by default.

Allowed changes:

1. Metadata-only governance updates (for example this policy file).
2. Approved migration-only edits with explicit architecture sign-off.

Any functional code changes under `archive/` require an approved exception documented in the PR and architecture review.
